### üíª Contributing Code

You don't need to be an expert programmer to contribute code! Here's a friendly step-by-step guide:

   - This helps prevent duplicate work and lets you get valuable input from the community
   - Don't be shy - we're a friendly bunch!

3. **Fork the repository**

   - This creates your own copy of the code to work with
